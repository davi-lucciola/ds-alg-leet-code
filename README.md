### Algorithms

#### Two Pointers

The "two pointers" algorithm consists in use two variables to iterate the array in most eficient way depending on the problem. Here is the most common approachs:

1. Converging Pointers
> One pointer in left and other in right moving inversed

2. Paralellel Pointers
> Both pointers start in the same index, and move in the same direction

3. Trigger Based Pointers
> Both pointers start in the same index, but one of the pointers start to iterate first, and when we find a certain contition we init the iteration with the other.
